    Stealth technology’s improved military aviation by significantly diminishing aircraft’s visibility to
    radar and infrared sensors. Although, it has not rendered radar and heat-seeking technologies redundant yet. 
    In response to the difficulties posed by stealth, radar systems have adapted with large transformations such as 
    low-frequency radar,which is less affected by stealth materials, and multi-static radar, which detects signals 
    from multiple angles. Additionally, infrared tracking systems continue to improve, especially in identifying heat
    signatures from afterburner use. Despite the effectiveness of stealth, these detection technologies remain critical, 
    adapting to counter stealth capabilities. This ongoing technological arms race allows that both stealth and detection 
    systems continue to evolve in tandem, keeping radar and heat-seeking technologies relevant in modern air combat.

<pre id="Introduction_InText" class="ex1">
    Stealth technology has been a highlight of today’s military aviation, especially with the induction of fifth-generation 
    aircrafts like the F-22 Raptor, F-35 Lightning II, Sukhoi Su-57 and the Chinese JC-20. The design of these aircraft is 
    utilizing sophisticated technology that reduces the surface area (radar cross-section,” RCS”) on which radar can be reflected
    to detect oncoming aircraft and infrared signature (the amount of heat an aircraft emits),making them harder to detect by 
    traditional radar and heat-seeking systems. Although, despite large advancements in stealth technology, radar and heat-seeking
    technology have not been left completely obsolete. Instead, both technologies have continued to develop alongside stealth, 
    with each driving improvements in the other’s respective fields. This essay will explore the reasons why radar and heat-seeking 
    technology remain pertinent, even though stealth capabilities act efficiently against these systems.

    <b><u>1. Evolution of Radar Technology</u></b>

    <b><u>1.1 Low-Frequency Radar</u></b> 

      One of the big leaps forward in radar technology has been the rival of low-frequency radar systems.
      Stealth technology's primary design focus is to render high-frequency radar useless, e.g. X-band radar,
      used by majority of today’s air defense systems & airborne radars (Eden, 2016). But, low-frequency radar,
      which works both in VHF (Very High Frequency) and UHF (Ultra High Frequency) bands, is less affected by
      the shape and composite of stealth materials Welch, 1989). Aircraft utilizing stealth design characteristics 
      are more efficient in reducing their radar cross-section in higher-frequency bands but are often more 
      detectable by low-frequency radars due to the physical size of the aircraft and the limits of stealth 
      material’s shaping in lower-frequency ranges (Sweetman, 2019). </pre>

      <pre id = "Analysis2" class="ex1">
      Low-frequency radar systems have further revived interest among nations seeking to counter the threat of 
      stealth aircraft. While these systems are normally less precise than high-frequency radars and can be prone
      to clutter from ground reflections, they can still serve as early warning systems (Goure, 2019). When a stealth
      (5th Generation) aircraft is detected by a low-frequency radar, the high-frequency radar can then be cued to 
      track and engage the target (Kennedy, 1993). Combining these radar systems allows for a layered technique towards
      enemy aircraft, hindering the stealth advantages.

    <b><u>1.2 Multi-Static Radar </u></b>

      Further advancements in radar technology are utilizing multi-static radar, comprising of multiple transmitters 
      and receivers placed at various locations. In conventional radar systems (monostatic), the transmitter and 
      receiver are positioned alongside each other, aiding stealth aircraft in reducing their radar cross-section by 
      reflecting signals away from the radar source (Welch, 1989). Multi-static radar detects radar signals reflected
      from different angles, making it difficult for stealth aircraft to evade detection (Davies & Barno, 2020). 

      Multi-static radar networks can be integrated with various sensors, e.g. infrared systems, to enhance detection 
      capabilities. As these systems continue to advance, it’s likely they’ll pose a significant challenge to stealth 
      aircraft, particularly in contested environments where adversaries deploy a variety of sensor technologies to 
      track stealthy platforms (Kim, 2023). 

    <u><b>2. The Limitations of Stealth Technology </b></u>

    <u><b>2.1 Limited Frequency Coverage </b></u>

      On a fundamental level, stealth technology is limited in combatting various radar types. As stealth aircraft are
      normally designed to evade detection using high-frequency radar. But they often struggle in reducing their radar
      cross-section in low-frequency bands (Goure, 2019). This is more evident when understanding that modern air defence
      systems often have a combination of radar types,including low-frequency radar for early warning and high-frequency
      radar for target tracking and engagement (Davis and Barno, 2014). 

      Furthermore, stealth outer layer coatings and materials degrade over time, particularly when exposed to the elements 
      (the environment it's operating in) such as moisture, temperature fluctuations, and operational wear and tear (Tariq, 2019). 
      Maintenance of these stealth features is costly and time-consuming, making it difficult to keep stealth aircraft in
      a constant state of readiness with the average price of an F-35 or F-22 being $100-122 million (Goure, 2019). In long
      term and large-scale conflict scenarios, the ability to maintain stealth may diminish, making aircraft more vulnerable
      to detection by advanced radar and infrared systems (Lee, 2019).

    <b><u>2.2 Thermal Signature Challenges</u></b> 

      
      Along with the difficulties posed by radar, stealth aircraft also face challenges in reducing their infrared signatures.
      Such as using afterburners creates a significant heat plume that can be detected by modern Infrared Search & Track systems
      (IRST)(Goure, 2019). While stealth aircraft are designed to decrease their thermal signature output, they can’t eliminate
      the heat generated by their engines; combustion being a vital process for engines to work (Kenndy, 1993). This makes them 
      susceptible to detection by heat-seeking missiles and infrared sensors, particularly when flying at high speeds or engaging
      in combat manoeuvres that require the use of afterburners (Lee, 2023). 
    </pre>

<pre id = "Analysis4" class="ex1">
    <b><u>Conclusion</u></b>
    
      Stealth technology has thoroughly changed the foundations of modern air combat, with air systems able to penetrate enemy 
      airspace with lower risk of detection. But it hasn’t made radar and heat-seeking technology obsolete. These technologies
      have evolved in response to the threats caused by stealth aircraft, with innovations such as low-frequency radar, multi-static
      radar, and advanced IRST systems allowing stealthy platforms to still be detected and tracked. Therefore, modern air combat
      has become a cat-and-mouse game, with stealth technology and sensor systems continuing to develop in tandem. Rather than 
      obsolescence, radar and heat-seeking technologies have been adapted to meet the demands of an era where stealth aircraft 
      play a prominent role.
